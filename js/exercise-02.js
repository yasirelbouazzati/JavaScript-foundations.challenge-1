    3. Log out this variable to the terminal using console.log
    
    Repeat the above steps but try using a const variable. Comment this new part of code and explain what is happening.

//Exemple of const error:


//declare the let variable
const vaca;
//initialize the variable
vaca"Moo!";
//print the messege
console.log(vaca);


Explanation of this error:
because I created the empty constant variable and below I put the value of the string variable, 
something that cannot be done in const since it would cause an error in the change in let, yes it can.
It also gave an error because I put the same variable name that I had in the let, which gave an error.


//Correct example of const:
const vaca1 = "Moo!";
console.log(vaca1);
